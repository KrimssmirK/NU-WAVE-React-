                            The Regional Invention Contest and Exhibits or RICE is a nationwide activity that recognizes the indispensability of Filipino inventors in the landscape of national economic development through appropriate platforms especially under the new normal (DOST, 2021). 
                            Dr. Ria Canlas walks her talk when it comes to innovation â€” through her invention, she is able to provide families around the world with modern, affordable, resilient, and sustainable homes.
